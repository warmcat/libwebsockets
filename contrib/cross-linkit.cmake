# cmake believes we should link a NOP test program OK, but since we're
# baremetal, that's not true in our case.  It tries to build this test
# with the cross compiler, but with no args on it, and it fails.
# So disable this test for this toolchain (we'll find out soon enough
# if we actually can't compile anything)

# Different build system distros set release optimization level to different
# things according to their local policy, eg, Fedora is -O2 and Ubuntu is -O3
# here.  Actually the build system's local policy is completely unrelated to
# our desire for cross-build release optimization policy for code built to run
# on a completely different target than the build system itself.
#
# Since this goes last on the compiler commandline we have to override it to a
# sane value for cross-build here.  Notice some gcc versions enable broken
# optimizations with -O3.
