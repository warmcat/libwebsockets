/**
 * lws_write() - Apply protocol then write data to client
 *
 * \param wsi:	Websocket instance (available from user callback)
 * \param buf:	The data to send.  For data being sent on a websocket
 *		connection (ie, not default http), this buffer MUST have
 *		LWS_PRE bytes valid BEFORE the pointer.
 *		This is so the protocol header data can be added in-situ.
 * \param len:	Count of the data bytes in the payload starting from buf
 * \param protocol:	Use LWS_WRITE_HTTP to reply to an http connection, and one
 *		of LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT to send appropriate
 *		data on a websockets connection.  Remember to allow the extra
 *		bytes before and after buf if LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT
 *		are used.
 *
 * This function provides the way to issue data back to the client, for any
 * role (h1, h2, ws, raw, etc).  It can only be called from the WRITEABLE
 * callback.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTICE!
 *
 * When sending with ws protocol
 *
 * LWS_WRITE_TEXT,
 * LWS_WRITE_BINARY,
 * LWS_WRITE_CONTINUATION,
 * LWS_WRITE_PING,
 * LWS_WRITE_PONG,
 *
 * or sending on http/2... the send buffer has to have LWS_PRE bytes valid
 * BEFORE the buffer pointer you pass to lws_write().  Since you'll probably
 * want to use http/2 before too long, it's wise to just always do this with
 * lws_write buffers... LWS_PRE is typically 16 bytes it's not going to hurt
 * usually.
 *
 * start of alloc       ptr passed to lws_write      end of allocation
 *       |                         |                         |
 *       v  <-- LWS_PRE bytes -->  v                         v
 *       [----------------  allocated memory  ---------------]
 *              (for lws use)      [====== user buffer ======]
 *
 * This allows us to add protocol info before the data, and send as one packet
 * on the network without payload copying, for maximum efficiency.
 *
 * So for example you need this kind of code to use lws_write with a
 * 128-byte payload
 *
 *   char buf[LWS_PRE + 128];
 *
 *   // fill your part of the buffer... for example here it's all zeros
 *   memset(&buf[LWS_PRE], 0, 128);
 *
 *   if (lws_write(wsi, &buf[LWS_PRE], 128, LWS_WRITE_TEXT) < 128) {
 *   		... the connection is dead ...
 *   		return -1;
 *   }
 *
 * LWS_PRE is currently 16, which covers ws and h2 frame headers, and is
 * compatible with 32 and 64-bit alignment requirements.
 *
 * (LWS_SEND_BUFFER_POST_PADDING is deprecated, it's now 0 and can be left off.)
 *
 * Return may be -1 is the write failed in a way indicating that the connection
 * has ended already, in which case you can close your side, or a positive
 * number that is at least the number of bytes requested to send (under some
 * encapsulation scenarios, it can indicate more than you asked was sent).
 *
 * The recommended test of the return is less than what you asked indicates
 * the connection has failed.
 *
 * Truncated Writes
 * ================
 *
 * The OS may not accept everything you asked to write on the connection.
 *
 * Posix defines POLLOUT indication from poll() to show that the connection
 * will accept more write data, but it doesn't specifiy how much.  It may just
 * accept one byte of whatever you wanted to send.
 *
 * LWS will buffer the remainder automatically, and send it out autonomously.
 *
 * During that time, WRITABLE callbacks to user code will be suppressed and
 * instead used internally.  After it completes, it will send an extra WRITEABLE
 * callback to the user code, in case any request was missed.  So it is possible
 * to receive unasked-for WRITEABLE callbacks, the user code should have enough
 * state to know if it wants to write anything and just return if not.
 *
 * This is to handle corner cases where unexpectedly the OS refuses what we
 * usually expect it to accept.  It's not recommended as the way to randomly
 * send huge payloads, since it is being copied on to heap and is inefficient.
 *
 * Huge payloads should instead be sent in fragments that are around 2 x mtu,
 * which is almost always directly accepted by the OS.  To simplify this for
 * ws fragments, there is a helper lws_write_ws_flags() below that simplifies
 * selecting the correct flags to give lws_write() for each fragment.
 *
 * In the case of RFC8441 ws-over-h2, you cannot send ws fragments larger than
 * the max h2 frame size, typically 16KB, but should further restrict it to
 * the same ~2 x mtu limit mentioned above.
