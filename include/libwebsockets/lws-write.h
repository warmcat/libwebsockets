/**
 * lws_write() - Apply protocol then write data to client
 * \param wsi:	Websocket instance (available from user callback)
 * \param buf:	The data to send.  For data being sent on a websocket
 *		connection (ie, not default http), this buffer MUST have
 *		LWS_PRE bytes valid BEFORE the pointer.
 *		This is so the protocol header data can be added in-situ.
 * \param len:	Count of the data bytes in the payload starting from buf
 * \param protocol:	Use LWS_WRITE_HTTP to reply to an http connection, and one
 *		of LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT to send appropriate
 *		data on a websockets connection.  Remember to allow the extra
 *		bytes before and after buf if LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT
 *		are used.
 *
 *	This function provides the way to issue data back to the client
 *	for both http and websocket protocols.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTICE!
 *
 * When sending with websocket protocol
 *
 * LWS_WRITE_TEXT,
 * LWS_WRITE_BINARY,
 * LWS_WRITE_CONTINUATION,
 * LWS_WRITE_PING,
 * LWS_WRITE_PONG
 *
 * the send buffer has to have LWS_PRE bytes valid BEFORE
 * the buffer pointer you pass to lws_write().
 *
 * This allows us to add protocol info before and after the data, and send as
 * one packet on the network without payload copying, for maximum efficiency.
 *
 * So for example you need this kind of code to use lws_write with a
 * 128-byte payload
 *
 *   char buf[LWS_PRE + 128];
 *
 *   // fill your part of the buffer... for example here it's all zeros
 *   memset(&buf[LWS_PRE], 0, 128);
 *
 *   lws_write(wsi, &buf[LWS_PRE], 128, LWS_WRITE_TEXT);
 *
 * When sending HTTP, with
 *
 * LWS_WRITE_HTTP,
 * LWS_WRITE_HTTP_HEADERS
 * LWS_WRITE_HTTP_FINAL
 *
 * there is no protocol data prepended, and don't need to take care about the
 * LWS_PRE bytes valid before the buffer pointer.
 *
 * LWS_PRE is at least the frame nonce + 2 header + 8 length
 * LWS_SEND_BUFFER_POST_PADDING is deprecated, it's now 0 and can be left off.
 * The example apps no longer use it.
 *
 * Pad LWS_PRE to the CPU word size, so that word references
 * to the address immediately after the padding won't cause an unaligned access
 * error. Sometimes for performance reasons the recommended padding is even
 * larger than sizeof(void *).
 *
 *	In the case of sending using websocket protocol, be sure to allocate
 *	valid storage before and after buf as explained above.  This scheme
 *	allows maximum efficiency of sending data and protocol in a single
 *	packet while not burdening the user code with any protocol knowledge.
 *
 *	Return may be -1 for a fatal error needing connection close, or the
 *	number of bytes sent.
 *
 * Truncated Writes
 * ================
 *
 * The OS may not accept everything you asked to write on the connection.
 *
 * Posix defines POLLOUT indication from poll() to show that the connection
 * will accept more write data, but it doesn't specifiy how much.  It may just
 * accept one byte of whatever you wanted to send.
 *
 * LWS will buffer the remainder automatically, and send it out autonomously.
 *
 * During that time, WRITABLE callbacks will be suppressed.
 *
 * This is to handle corner cases where unexpectedly the OS refuses what we
 * usually expect it to accept.  You should try to send in chunks that are
 * almost always accepted in order to avoid the inefficiency of the buffering.
