 *
 *  LWS requires that there is one context, in which you may define multiple
 *  vhosts.  Each vhost is a virtual host, with either its own listen port
 *  or sharing an existing one.  Each vhost has its own SSL context that can
 *  be set up individually or left disabled.
 *
 *  If you don't care about multiple "site" support, you can ignore it and
 *  lws will create a single default vhost at context creation time.
