 * Information about how this protocol handles multiple use of connections.
 *
 * .flags of 0 indicates each connection must start with a fresh transport.
 *
 * Flags can be used to indicate the protocol itself supports different
 * kinds of multiple use.  However the actual use or not of these may depend on
 * negotiation with the remote peer.
 *
 * LWSABSPR_FLAG_PIPELINE:	other instances can be queued on one with an
 *				existing connection and get a chance to "hot
 *				take over" the existing transport in turn, like
 *				h1 keepalive pipelining
 *
 * LWSABSPR_FLAG_MUX_STREAMS:	an existing connection can absorb more child
 *				connections and mux them as separate child
 *				streams ongoing, like h2
