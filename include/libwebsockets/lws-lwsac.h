 *
 * ##Allocated Chunks
 *
 * If you know you will be allocating a large, unknown number of same or
 * differently sized objects, it's certainly possible to do it with libc
 * malloc.  However the allocation cost in time and memory overhead can
 * add up, and deallocation means walking the structure of every object and
 * freeing them in turn.
 *
 * lwsac (LWS Allocated Chunks) allocates chunks intended to be larger
 * than your objects (4000 bytes by default) which you linearly allocate from
 * using lwsac_use().
 *
 * If your next request won't fit in the current chunk, a new chunk is added
 * to the chain of chunks and the allocaton done from there.  If the request
 * is larger than the chunk size, an oversize chunk is created to satisfy it.
 *
 * When you are finished with the allocations, you call lwsac_free() and
 * free all the *chunks*.  So you may have thousands of objects in the chunks,
 * but they are all destroyed with the chunks without having to deallocate them
 * one by one pointlessly.
