 *
 * Secure Streams is a *payload-only* client communication channel where all the
 * details about the connection are held in a systemwide policy database and
 * are keyed by the streamtype field... the user of the communication channel
 * does not know or manage the choice of endpoint, tls CA, or even wire
 * protocol.  The advantage is he then does not have any dependency on any of
 * those and they can be changed just by changing the policy database without
 * touching the code using the stream.
 *
 * There are two ways secure streams interfaces to user code:
 *
 * 1) [Linux / RTOS] the natural, smallest interface is to call back to user
 *    code that only operates directly from the lws event loop thread context
 *    (direct callbacks from lws_ss_t)
 *
 *    lws_thread( [user code] ---- lws )
 *
 * 2) [Linux] where the user code is in a different process and communicates
 *    asynchronously via a proxy socket
 *
 *    user_process{ [user code] | shim | socket-}------ lws_process{ lws }
 *
 * In the second, IPC, case, all packets are prepended by one or more bytes
 * indicating the packet type and serializing any associated data, known as
 * Serialized Secure Streams or SSS.
 *
 * Serialized Secure Streams
 * -------------------------
 *
 * On the transport, adjacent packets may be coalesced, that is, the original
 * packet sizes are lost and two or more packets are combined.  For that reason
 * the serialization format always contains a 1-byte type and then a 2-byte
 * frame length.

 *
 * Sinks
 * -----
 *
 * Sinks are logical "servers", you can register as a sink for a particular
 * streamtype by using the lws_ss_create() api with ssi->register_sink set to 1.
 *
 * For directly fulfilled Secure Streams, new streams of that streamtype bind
 * to the rx, tx and state handlers given when it was registered.
 *
 *  - When new streams are created the registered sink handler for (*state) is
 *    called with event LWSSSCS_SINK_JOIN and the new client stream handle in
 *    the h_src parameter.
 *
 *  - When the client stream sends something to the sink, it calls the sink's
 *    (*rx) with the client stream's
