 * \param user:	Pointer to ptr to per-session user data allocated by library
 * \param in:		Pointer used for some callback reasons
 * \param len:	Length set for some callback reasons
 *
 *	Each extension that is active on a particular connection receives
 *	callbacks during the connection lifetime to allow the extension to
 *	operate on websocket data and manage itself.
 *
 *	Libwebsockets takes care of allocating and freeing "user" memory for
 *	each active extension on each connection.  That is what is pointed to
 *	by the user parameter.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_CONSTRUCT:  called when the server has decided to
 *		select this extension from the list provided by the client,
 *		just before the server will send back the handshake accepting
 *		the connection with this extension active.  This gives the
 *		extension a chance to initialize its connection context found
 *		in user.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_CLIENT_CONSTRUCT: same as LWS_EXT_CB_CONSTRUCT
 *		but called when client is instantiating this extension.  Some
 *		extensions will work the same on client and server side and then
 *		you can just merge handlers for both CONSTRUCTS.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_DESTROY:  called when the connection the extension was
 *		being used on is about to be closed and deallocated.  It's the
 *		last chance for the extension to deallocate anything it has
 *		allocated in the user data (pointed to by user) before the
 *		user data is deleted.  This same callback is used whether you
 *		are in client or server instantiation context.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_PACKET_TX_PRESEND: this works the same way as
 *		LWS_EXT_CB_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE above, except it gives the
 *		extension a chance to change websocket data just before it will
 *		be sent out.  Using the same lws_token pointer scheme in in,
 *		the extension can change the buffer and the length to be
 *		transmitted how it likes.  Again if it wants to grow the
 *		buffer safely, it should copy the data into its own buffer and
 *		set the lws_tokens token pointer to it.
