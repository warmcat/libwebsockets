 * Protocols bind ws protocol names to a custom callback specific to that
 * protocol implementaion.
 *
 * A list of protocols can be passed in at context creation time, but it is
 * also legal to leave that NULL and add the protocols and their callback code
 * using plugins.
 *
 * Plugins are much preferable compared to cut and pasting code into an
 * application each time, since they can be used standalone.
