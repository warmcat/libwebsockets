 *
 * This is a JSON-RPC parser and state management implementation that's:
 *
 *  - Lightweight, it uses lws LEJP JSON stream parser for requests, responses,
 *    and user-defined parameter objects
 *
 *  - Stateful... you can give it sequential input buffers randomly fragmented
 *    and it will complete when it has enough
 *
 *  - Asynchronous... response processing can return to the event loop both
 *    while the RX is still coming and after it's all received before forming
 *    the response, eg, because it's querying on a remote connection to get the
 *    response data.  Any number of RPCs can be either in flight or waiting for
 *    response processing to complete before responding.
 *
 *  - Supports "version" extension
 *
 *  - allows binding different method names to different callbacks
 *
 *  - Supports both client and server roles, eg, can parse both requests and
 *    responses
 *
 *  - No support for batch.  Batching is not widely used because it doesn't
 *    add anything for the vast bulk of cases compared to sending n requests.
 *
 * This handles client and server RX and transaction state, creating a callback
 * when parameters can be parsed and all of the request or notification is
 * done.
 *
 * Producing JSON is usually simpler and more compact than expressing it as an
 * object model, ie often a response can be completely formed in a single
 * lws_snprintf().  Response JSON must be buffered on heap until the method
 * callback is called with NULL / 0 buf len indicating that the incoming request
 * has completed parsing.
