 * lws_dsh (Disordered Shared Heap) is an opaque abstraction supporting a single
 * linear buffer (overallocated at end of the lws_dsh_t) which may contain
 * multiple kinds of packets that are retired out of order, and tracked by kind.
 *
 * Each kind of packet has an lws_dll2 list of its kind of packets and acts as
 * a FIFO; packets of a particular type are always retired in order.  But there
 * is no requirement about the order types are retired matching the original
 * order they arrived.
 * 
 * Gaps are tracked as just another kind of "packet" list.
 *
 * "allocations" (including gaps) are prepended by an lws_dsh_object_t.
 *
 * dsh may themselves be on an lws_dll2_owner list, and under memory pressure
 * allocate into other buffers on the list.
 *
 * All management structures exist inside the allocated buffer.
