This directory contains an Android Studio (2.1.1) project that builds
libwebsockets (+ openssl + zlib) and an Android application that is able
to connect to the 'dumb-increment-protocol' of the libwebsockets test server.

Building the native libraries requires the Android NDK which can be
installed using the SDK manager.

The app/src/main/jni/NativeLibs.mk is fully integraded with Gradle but will
only work on Linux and requires the following applications to be available
in addition to the NDK:

   awk cmake egrep git tar wget makedepend

(makedepend can be installed from (Debian) xutils-dev)

To build the project:

- Open an 'existing project' with Android Studio and select this directory.
  (answer yes/ok to the question to integrate with Gradle).

- Open the file app/src/main/jni/Application.mk and make sure NDK_ROOT
  is set correctly and that APP_PLATFORM is set to the appropriate API level.

- Build the project with CTRL+F9
  (open the gradle console to follow the build progress).

- Install APK to device and run.

- Connect to libwebsockets test server.
