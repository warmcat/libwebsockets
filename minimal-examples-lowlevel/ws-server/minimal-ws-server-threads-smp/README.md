# lws minimal ws server (threads) + SMP

This demonstrates both independent threads creating content
as in the -threads example, and multiple service threads
as in the http-server-smp example (but with ws).

## build

You must first build libwebsockets itself with cmake `-DLWS_MAX_SMP=8`
or some other number greater than one.

```
 $ cmake . && make
```

Pthreads is required on your system.

## usage

```
 $ ./lws-minimal-ws-server-threads-smp
[2019/01/28 06:59:17:4217] USER: LWS minimal ws server + threads + smp | visit http://localhost:7681
[2019/01/28 06:59:17:4219] NOTICE:   Service threads: 2

```

Visit http://localhost:7681 on multiple browser windows.  You may need to open
4 before the second service thread is used (check "svc tid" in the browser output).

Two lws service threads are started.

Two separate asynchronous threads generate strings and add them to a ringbuffer,
signalling all lws service threads to send new entries to all the browser windows.

This demonstrates how to safely manage asynchronously generated content
and hook it up to the lws service threads.
