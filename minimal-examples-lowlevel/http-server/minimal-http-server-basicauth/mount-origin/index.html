		Hello from the <b>minimal http server basic auth example</b>.
		<p>
		This is a static page served from ./mount-origin/index.html.
		<p>
		Stuff down /secret in the URL space is protected by Basic Auth.<br>
		Your browser will ask for a username / password combination, and<br>
		lws will check it against ./ba-passwords, which contains a list of<br>
		"username:password" one per line.<br>
		<br>
		The example content for ba-passwords is literally "user:password".<br>
		Click on the link into the protected area of the URL space below<br>
		and give your browser the credentials "user" and "password".
		<p>
		<a href="/secret/" target=_blank>/secret</a>
