<b>lws_write</b>
(<i>struct lws *</i> <b>wsi</b>,

<i>enum lws_write_protocol</i> <b>protocol</b>)
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>wsi</b>
<dd>Websocket instance (available from user callback)
<dt><b>buf</b>
<dd>The data to send.  For data being sent on a websocket
connection (ie, not default http), this buffer MUST have
LWS_SEND_BUFFER_PRE_PADDING bytes valid BEFORE the pointer
and an additional LWS_SEND_BUFFER_POST_PADDING bytes valid
in the buffer after (buf + len).  This is so the protocol
header and trailer data can be added in-situ.
<dt><b>len</b>
<dd>Count of the data bytes in the payload starting from buf
<dt><b>protocol</b>
<dd>Use LWS_WRITE_HTTP to reply to an http connection, and one
of LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT to send appropriate
data on a websockets connection.  Remember to allow the extra
bytes before and after buf if LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT
are used.
</dl>
<h3>Description</h3>
<blockquote>
This function provides the way to issue data back to the client
for both http and websocket protocols.
<p>
In the case of sending using websocket protocol, be sure to allocate
valid storage before and after buf as explained above.  This scheme
allows maximum efficiency of sending data and protocol in a single
packet while not burdening the user code with any protocol knowledge.
<p>
Return may be -1 for a fatal error needing connection close, or a
positive number reflecting the amount of bytes actually sent.  This
can be less than the requested number of bytes due to OS memory
pressure at any given time.

This function takes a pollfd that has POLLIN or POLLOUT activity and
services it according to the state of the associated

<p>
The one call deals with all "service" that might happen on a socket
including listen accepts, http files as well as websocket protocol.
<p>
If a pollfd says it has something, you can just pass it to
<b>lws_service_fd</b> whether it is a socket handled by lws or not.
If it sees it is a lws socket, the traffic will be handled and
pollfd-&gt;revents will be zeroed now.
<p>
If the socket is foreign to lws, it leaves revents alone.  So you can
see if you should service yourself by checking the pollfd revents
after letting lws try to service it.

<dt><b>timeout_ms</b>
<dd>Timeout for poll; 0 means return immediately if nothing needed
service otherwise block and service immediately, returning
after the timeout if nothing needed service.
</dl>
<h3>Description</h3>
<blockquote>
This function deals with any pending websocket traffic, for three
kinds of event.  It handles these events on both server and client
types of connection the same.
<p>
1) Accept new connections to our context's server
<p>
2) Call the receive callback for incoming frame data received by
server or client connections.
<p>
You need to call this service function periodically to all the above
functions to happen; if your application is single-threaded you can
just call it in your main event loop.
<p>
Alternatively you can fork a new process that asynchronously handles
calling this service in a loop.  In that case you are happy if this
call blocks your thread until it needs to take care of something and
would call it with a large nonzero timeout.  Your loop then takes no
CPU while there is nothing happening.
<p>
If you are calling it in a single-threaded app, you don't want it to
wait around blocking other things in your loop from happening, so you
would call it with a timeout_ms of 0, so it returns immediately if
nothing is pending, or as soon as it services whatever was pending.

This function is intended to be called from the callback if the

This function creates the listening socket (if serving) and takes care

<p>
The protocol callback functions are called for a handful of events
including http requests coming in, websocket connections becoming
established, and data arriving; it's also called periodically to allow
async transmission.
<p>
HTTP requests are sent always to the FIRST protocol in <tt><b>protocol</b></tt>, since
at that time websocket protocol has not been negotiated.  Other
protocols after the first one never see any HTTP callack activity.
<p>
The server created is a simple http server by default; part of the

<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_HTTP_FILE_COMPLETION</h3>
<blockquote>
a file requested to be send down
http link has completed.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_SERVER_WRITEABLE</h3>
<blockquote>
If you call
<b>lws_callback_on_writable</b> on a connection, you will
get one of these callbacks coming when the connection socket
is able to accept another write packet without blocking.
If it already was able to take another packet without blocking,
you'll get this callback at the next call to the service loop
function.  Notice that CLIENTs get LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_WRITEABLE
and servers get LWS_CALLBACK_SERVER_WRITEABLE.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_FILTER_NETWORK_CONNECTION</h3>
<blockquote>
called when a client connects to
the server at network level; the connection is accepted but then
passed to this callback to decide whether to hang up immediately
or not, based on the client IP.  <tt><b>in</b></tt> contains the connection
socket's descriptor. Since the client connection information is
not available yet, <tt><b>wsi</b></tt> still pointing to the main server socket.
Return non-zero to terminate the connection before sending or
receiving anything. Because this happens immediately after the
network connection from the client, there's no websocket protocol
selected yet so this callback is issued only to protocol 0.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_SERVER_NEW_CLIENT_INSTANTIATED</h3>
<blockquote>
A new client just had
been connected, accepted, and instantiated into the pool. This
callback allows setting any relevant property to it. Because this
happens immediately after the instantiation of a new client,
there's no websocket protocol selected yet so this callback is
issued only to protocol 0. Only <tt><b>wsi</b></tt> is defined, pointing to the
new client, and the return value is ignored.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_FILTER_HTTP_CONNECTION</h3>
<blockquote>
called when the request has
been received and parsed from the client, but the response is
not sent yet.  Return non-zero to disallow the connection.
<tt><b>user</b></tt> is a pointer to the connection user space allocation,
<tt><b>in</b></tt> is the URI, eg, "/"
In your handler you can use the public APIs
<b>lws_hdr_total_length</b> / <b>lws_hdr_copy</b> to access all of the
headers using the header enums lws_token_indexes from
libwebsockets.h to check for and read the supported header
presence and content before deciding to allow the http
connection to proceed or to kill the connection.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_FILTER_PROTOCOL_CONNECTION</h3>
<blockquote>
called when the handshake has
been received and parsed from the client, but the response is
not sent yet.  Return non-zero to disallow the connection.
<tt><b>user</b></tt> is a pointer to the connection user space allocation,
<tt><b>in</b></tt> is the requested protocol name
In your handler you can use the public APIs
<b>lws_hdr_total_length</b> / <b>lws_hdr_copy</b> to access all of the
headers using the header enums lws_token_indexes from
libwebsockets.h to check for and read the supported header
presence and content before deciding to allow the handshake
to proceed or to kill the connection.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_LOAD_EXTRA_CLIENT_VERIFY_CERTS</h3>
<blockquote>
if configured for
including OpenSSL support, this callback allows your user code
to perform extra <b>SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations</b> or similar
calls to direct OpenSSL where to find certificates the client
can use to confirm the remote server identity.  <tt><b>user</b></tt> is the
OpenSSL SSL_CTX*
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_LOAD_EXTRA_SERVER_VERIFY_CERTS</h3>
<blockquote>
if configured for
including OpenSSL support, this callback allows your user code
to load extra certifcates into the server which allow it to
verify the validity of certificates returned by clients.  <tt><b>user</b></tt>
is the server's OpenSSL SSL_CTX*
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_CONTEXT_REQUIRES_PRIVATE_KEY</h3>
<blockquote>
if configured for
including OpenSSL support but no private key file has been specified
(ssl_private_key_filepath is NULL), this callback is called to
allow the user to set the private key directly via libopenssl
and perform further operations if required; this might be useful
in situations where the private key is not directly accessible by
the OS, for example if it is stored on a smartcard
<tt><b>user</b></tt> is the server's OpenSSL SSL_CTX*
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_PERFORM_CLIENT_CERT_VERIFICATION</h3>
<blockquote>
if the
libwebsockets context was created with the option
LWS_SERVER_OPTION_REQUIRE_VALID_OPENSSL_CLIENT_CERT, then this
callback is generated during OpenSSL verification of the cert
sent from the client.  It is sent to protocol[0] callback as
no protocol has been negotiated on the connection yet.
Notice that the libwebsockets context and wsi are both NULL
during this callback.  See
</blockquote>
<h3>http</h3>
<blockquote>
//www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html
to understand more detail about the OpenSSL callback that
generates this libwebsockets callback and the meanings of the
arguments passed.  In this callback, <tt><b>user</b></tt> is the x509_ctx,
<tt><b>in</b></tt> is the ssl pointer and <tt><b>len</b></tt> is preverify_ok
Notice that this callback maintains libwebsocket return
conventions, return 0 to mean the cert is OK or 1 to fail it.
This also means that if you don't handle this callback then
the default callback action of returning 0 allows the client
certificates.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_APPEND_HANDSHAKE_HEADER</h3>
<blockquote>
this callback happens
when a client handshake is being compiled.  <tt><b>user</b></tt> is NULL,
<tt><b>in</b></tt> is a char **, it's pointing to a char * which holds the
next location in the header buffer where you can add
headers, and <tt><b>len</b></tt> is the remaining space in the header buffer,
which is typically some hundreds of bytes.  So, to add a canned
cookie, your handler code might look similar to:
<p>
char **p = (char **)in;
<p>
if (len &lt; 100)
return 1;
<p>
*p += sprintf(*p, "Cookie: a=b\x0d\x0a");
<p>
return 0;
<p>
Notice if you add anything, you just have to take care about
the CRLF on the line you added.  Obviously this callback is
optional, if you don't handle it everything is fine.
<p>
Notice the callback is coming to protocols[0] all the time,
because there is no specific protocol handshook yet.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_CONFIRM_EXTENSION_OKAY</h3>
<blockquote>
When the server handshake code
sees that it does support a requested extension, before
accepting the extension by additing to the list sent back to
the client it gives this callback just to check that it's okay
to use that extension.  It calls back to the requested protocol
and with <tt><b>in</b></tt> being the extension name, <tt><b>len</b></tt> is 0 and <tt><b>user</b></tt> is
valid.  Note though at this time the ESTABLISHED callback hasn't
happened yet so if you initialize <tt><b>user</b></tt> content there, <tt><b>user</b></tt>
content during this callback might not be useful for anything.
Notice this callback comes to protocols[0].
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_CONFIRM_EXTENSION_SUPPORTED</h3>
<blockquote>
When a client
connection is being prepared to start a handshake to a server,
each supported extension is checked with protocols[0] callback
with this reason, giving the user code a chance to suppress the
claim to support that extension by returning non-zero.  If
unhandled, by default 0 will be returned and the extension
support included in the header to the server.  Notice this
callback comes to protocols[0].
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_PROTOCOL_INIT</h3>
<blockquote>
One-time call per protocol so it can
do initial setup / allocations etc
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_PROTOCOL_DESTROY</h3>
<blockquote>
One-time call per protocol indicating
this protocol won't get used at all after this callback, the
context is getting destroyed.  Take the opportunity to
deallocate everything that was allocated by the protocol.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_WSI_CREATE</h3>
<blockquote>
outermost (earliest) wsi create notification
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_WSI_DESTROY</h3>
<blockquote>
outermost (latest) wsi destroy notification
<p>
The next five reasons are optional and only need taking care of if you
will be integrating libwebsockets sockets into an external polling
array.
<p>
For these calls, <tt><b>in</b></tt> points to a struct lws_pollargs that
contains <tt><b>fd</b></tt>, <tt><b>events</b></tt> and <tt><b>prev_events</b></tt> members
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_ADD_POLL_FD</h3>
<blockquote>
libwebsocket deals with its <b>poll</b> loop
internally, but in the case you are integrating with another
server you will need to have libwebsocket sockets share a
polling array with the other server.  This and the other
POLL_FD related callbacks let you put your specialized
poll array interface code in the callback for protocol 0, the
first protocol you support, usually the HTTP protocol in the
serving case.
This callback happens when a socket needs to be
</blockquote>
<h3>added to the polling loop</h3>
<blockquote>
<tt><b>in</b></tt> points to a struct
lws_pollargs; the <tt><b>fd</b></tt> member of the struct is the file
descriptor, and <tt><b>events</b></tt> contains the active events.
<p>
If you are using the internal polling loop (the "service"
callback), you can just ignore these callbacks.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_DEL_POLL_FD</h3>
<blockquote>
This callback happens when a socket descriptor
needs to be removed from an external polling array.  <tt><b>in</b></tt> is
again the struct lws_pollargs containing the <tt><b>fd</b></tt> member
to be removed.  If you are using the internal polling
loop, you can just ignore it.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_CHANGE_MODE_POLL_FD</h3>
<blockquote>
This callback happens when
libwebsockets wants to modify the events for a connectiion.
<tt><b>in</b></tt> is the struct lws_pollargs with the <tt><b>fd</b></tt> to change.
The new event mask is in <tt><b>events</b></tt> member and the old mask is in
the <tt><b>prev_events</b></tt> member.
If you are using the internal polling loop, you can just ignore
it.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_CALLBACK_UNLOCK_POLL</h3>
<blockquote>
These allow the external poll changes driven
by libwebsockets to participate in an external thread locking
scheme around the changes, so the whole thing is threadsafe.
These are called around three activities in the library,
- inserting a new wsi in the wsi / fd table (len=1)
- deleting a wsi from the wsi / fd table (len=1)
- changing a wsi's POLLIN/OUT state (len=0)
Locking and unlocking external synchronization objects when
len == 1 allows external threads to be synchronized against
wsi lifecycle changes if it acquires the same lock for the
duration of wsi dereference from the other thread context.

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>context</b>
<dd>Websockets context
<dt><b>ext</b>
<dd>This extension
<dt><b>wsi</b>
<dd>Opaque websocket instance pointer

<h3>Description</h3>
<blockquote>
Each extension that is active on a particular connection receives
callbacks during the connection lifetime to allow the extension to
operate on websocket data and manage itself.
<p>
Libwebsockets takes care of allocating and freeing "user" memory for
each active extension on each connection.  That is what is pointed to
by the <tt><b>user</b></tt> parameter.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_CONSTRUCT</h3>
<blockquote>
called when the server has decided to
select this extension from the list provided by the client,
just before the server will send back the handshake accepting
the connection with this extension active.  This gives the
extension a chance to initialize its connection context found
in <tt><b>user</b></tt>.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_CLIENT_CONSTRUCT</h3>
<blockquote>
same as LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_CONSTRUCT
but called when client is instantiating this extension.  Some
extensions will work the same on client and server side and then
you can just merge handlers for both CONSTRUCTS.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_DESTROY</h3>
<blockquote>
called when the connection the extension was
being used on is about to be closed and deallocated.  It's the
last chance for the extension to deallocate anything it has
allocated in the user data (pointed to by <tt><b>user</b></tt>) before the
user data is deleted.  This same callback is used whether you
are in client or server instantiation context.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE</h3>
<blockquote>
when this extension was active on
a connection, and a packet of data arrived at the connection,
it is passed to this callback to give the extension a chance to
change the data, eg, decompress it.  <tt><b>user</b></tt> is pointing to the
extension's private connection context data, <tt><b>in</b></tt> is pointing
to an lws_tokens struct, it consists of a char * pointer called
token, and an int called token_len.  At entry, these are
set to point to the received buffer and set to the content
length.  If the extension will grow the content, it should use
a new buffer allocated in its private user context data and
set the pointed-to lws_tokens members to point to its buffer.
</blockquote>
<h3>LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_PACKET_TX_PRESEND</h3>
<blockquote>
this works the same way as
LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE above, except it gives the
extension a chance to change websocket data just before it will
be sent out.  Using the same lws_token pointer scheme in <tt><b>in</b></tt>,
the extension can change the buffer and the length to be
transmitted how it likes.  Again if it wants to grow the
buffer safely, it should copy the data into its own buffer and
set the lws_tokens token pointer to it.
