 * ##User protocol callback
 *
 * The protocol callback is the primary way lws interacts with
 * user code.  For one of a list of a few dozen reasons the callback gets
 * called at some event to be handled.
 *
 * All of the events can be ignored, returning 0 is taken as "OK" and returning
 * nonzero in most cases indicates that the connection should be closed.

 *
 *	Each extension that is active on a particular connection receives
 *	callbacks during the connection lifetime to allow the extension to
 *	operate on websocket data and manage itself.
 *
 *	Libwebsockets takes care of allocating and freeing "user" memory for
 *	each active extension on each connection.  That is what is pointed to
 *	by the user parameter.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_CONSTRUCT:  called when the server has decided to
 *		select this extension from the list provided by the client,
 *		just before the server will send back the handshake accepting
 *		the connection with this extension active.  This gives the
 *		extension a chance to initialize its connection context found
 *		in user.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_CLIENT_CONSTRUCT: same as LWS_EXT_CB_CONSTRUCT
 *		but called when client is instantiating this extension.  Some
 *		extensions will work the same on client and server side and then
 *		you can just merge handlers for both CONSTRUCTS.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_DESTROY:  called when the connection the extension was
 *		being used on is about to be closed and deallocated.  It's the
 *		last chance for the extension to deallocate anything it has
 *		allocated in the user data (pointed to by user) before the
 *		user data is deleted.  This same callback is used whether you
 *		are in client or server instantiation context.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE: when this extension was active on
 *		a connection, and a packet of data arrived at the connection,
 *		it is passed to this callback to give the extension a chance to
 *		change the data, eg, decompress it.  user is pointing to the
 *		extension's private connection context data, in is pointing
 *		to an lws_tokens struct, it consists of a char * pointer called
 *		token, and an int called token_len.  At entry, these are
 *		set to point to the received buffer and set to the content
 *		length.  If the extension will grow the content, it should use
 *		a new buffer allocated in its private user context data and
 *		set the pointed-to lws_tokens members to point to its buffer.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CB_PACKET_TX_PRESEND: this works the same way as
 *		LWS_EXT_CB_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE above, except it gives the
 *		extension a chance to change websocket data just before it will
 *		be sent out.  Using the same lws_token pointer scheme in in,
 *		the extension can change the buffer and the length to be
 *		transmitted how it likes.  Again if it wants to grow the
 *		buffer safely, it should copy the data into its own buffer and
 *		set the lws_tokens token pointer to it.

/** \defgroup HTTP-headers-read HTTP headers: read

 *
 * ##HTTP header releated functions
 *
 *  In lws the client http headers are temporarily stored in a pool, only for the
 *  duration of the http part of the handshake.  It's because in most cases,
 *  the header content is ignored for the whole rest of the connection lifetime
 *  and would then just be taking up space needlessly.
 *
 *  During LWS_CALLBACK_HTTP when the URI path is delivered is the last time
 *  the http headers are still allocated, you can use these apis then to
 *  look at and copy out interesting header content (cookies, etc)
 *
 *  Notice that the header total length reported does not include a terminating
 *  '\0', however you must allocate for it when using the _copy apis.  So the
 *  length reported for a header containing "123" is 3, but you must provide
 *  a buffer of length 4 so that "123\0" may be copied into it, or the copy
 *  will fail with a nonzero return code.
 *
 *  In the special case of URL arguments, like ?x=1&y=2, the arguments are
 *  stored in a token named for the method, eg,  WSI_TOKEN_GET_URI if it
 *  was a GET or WSI_TOKEN_POST_URI if POST.  You can check the total
 *  length to confirm the method.
 *
 *  For URL arguments, each argument is stored urldecoded in a "fragment", so
 *  you can use the fragment-aware api lws_hdr_copy_fragment() to access each
 *  argument in turn: the fragments contain urldecoded strings like x=1 or y=2.
 *
 *  As a convenience, lws has an api that will find the fragment with a
 *  given name= part, lws_get_urlarg_by_name().

 *		This is so the protocol header data can be added in-situ.
 * \param len:	Count of the data bytes in the payload starting from buf
 * \param protocol:	Use LWS_WRITE_HTTP to reply to an http connection, and one
 *		of LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT to send appropriate
 *		data on a websockets connection.  Remember to allow the extra
 *		bytes before and after buf if LWS_WRITE_BINARY or LWS_WRITE_TEXT
 *		are used.
 *
 *	This function provides the way to issue data back to the client
 *	for both http and websocket protocols.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTICE!
 *
 * When sending with websocket protocol
 *
 * LWS_WRITE_TEXT,
 * LWS_WRITE_BINARY,
 * LWS_WRITE_CONTINUATION,
 * LWS_WRITE_PING,
 * LWS_WRITE_PONG
 *
 * the send buffer has to have LWS_PRE bytes valid BEFORE
 * the buffer pointer you pass to lws_write().
 *
 * This allows us to add protocol info before and after the data, and send as
 * one packet on the network without payload copying, for maximum efficiency.
 *
 * So for example you need this kind of code to use lws_write with a
 * 128-byte payload
 *
 *   char buf[LWS_PRE + 128];
 *
 *   // fill your part of the buffer... for example here it's all zeros
 *   memset(&buf[LWS_PRE], 0, 128);
 *
 *   lws_write(wsi, &buf[LWS_PRE], 128, LWS_WRITE_TEXT);
 *
 * When sending HTTP, with
 *
 * LWS_WRITE_HTTP,
 * LWS_WRITE_HTTP_HEADERS
 * LWS_WRITE_HTTP_FINAL
 *
 * there is no protocol data prepended, and don't need to take care about the
 * LWS_PRE bytes valid before the buffer pointer.
 *
 * LWS_PRE is at least the frame nonce + 2 header + 8 length
 * LWS_SEND_BUFFER_POST_PADDING is deprecated, it's now 0 and can be left off.
 * The example apps no longer use it.
 *
 * Pad LWS_PRE to the CPU word size, so that word references
 * to the address immediately after the padding won't cause an unaligned access
 * error. Sometimes for performance reasons the recommended padding is even
 * larger than sizeof(void *).
 *
 *	In the case of sending using websocket protocol, be sure to allocate
 *	valid storage before and after buf as explained above.  This scheme
 *	allows maximum efficiency of sending data and protocol in a single
 *	packet while not burdening the user code with any protocol knowledge.
 *
 *	Return may be -1 for a fatal error needing connection close, or the
 *	number of bytes sent.
 *
 * Truncated Writes
 * ================
 *
 * The OS may not accept everything you asked to write on the connection.
 *
 * Posix defines POLLOUT indication from poll() to show that the connection
 * will accept more write data, but it doesn't specifiy how much.  It may just
 * accept one byte of whatever you wanted to send.
 *
 * LWS will buffer the remainder automatically, and send it out autonomously.
 *
 * During that time, WRITABLE callbacks will be suppressed.
 *
 * This is to handle corner cases where unexpectedly the OS refuses what we
 * usually expect it to accept.  You should try to send in chunks that are
 * almost always accepted in order to avoid the inefficiency of the buffering.

/** \defgroup smtp
 * \ingroup lwsapi
 * ##SMTP related functions
 *
 * These apis let you communicate with a local SMTP server to send email from
 * lws.  It handles all the SMTP sequencing and protocol actions.
 *
 * Your system should have postfix, sendmail or another MTA listening on port
 * 25 and able to send email using the "mail" commandline app.  Usually distro
 * MTAs are configured for this by default.
 *
 * It runs via its own libuv events if initialized (which requires giving it
 * a libuv loop to attach to).
 *
 * It operates using three callbacks, on_next() queries if there is a new email
 * to send, on_get_body() asks for the body of the email, and on_sent() is
 * called after the email is successfully sent.
 *
 * To use it
 *
 *  - create an lws_email struct
 *
 *  - initialize data, loop, the email_* strings, max_content_size and
 *    the callbacks
 *
 *  - call lws_email_init()
 *
 *  When you have at least one email to send, call lws_email_check() to
 *  schedule starting to send it.
