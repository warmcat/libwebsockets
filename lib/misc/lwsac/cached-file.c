/*
 * Helper for caching a file in memory in a lac, but also to check at intervals
 * no less than 5s if the file is still fresh.
 *
 * Set *cache to NULL the first time before calling.
 *
 * You should call this each time before using the cache... if it's
 *
 *  - less than 5s since the last freshness check, and
 *  - the file is already in memory
 *
 * it just returns with *cache left alone; this costs very little.  You should
 * call `lwsac_use_cached_file_start()` and `lwsac_use_cached_file_end()` to lock
 * the cache against deletion while you are using it.
 *
 * If it's
 *
 *  - at least 5s since the last freshness check, and
 *  - the file timestamp has changed
 *
 * then
 *
 *  - the file is reloaded into a new lac and *cache set to that
 *
 *  - the old cache lac, if any, is detached (so it will be freed when its
 *    reference count reaches zero, or immediately if nobody has it)
 *
 * Note the call can fail due to OOM or filesystem issue at any time.
 *
 *
 * After the LAC header there is stored a `struct cached_file_info` and then
 * the raw file contents.  *
 *
 *  [LAC header]
 *  [struct cached_file_info]
 *  [file contents]  <--- *cache is set to here
 *
 * The api returns a lwsac_cached_file_t type offset to point to the file
 * contents.  Helpers for reference counting and freeing are also provided
 * that take that type and know how to correct it back to operate on the LAC.
