/*
 * Const struct that describes a policy for processing raw metrics to turn them
 * into events.
 *
 * Typically although we want to monitor every event, the data produced can be
 * too large, and many events that are "normal" just need to be counted as such;
 * outliers or change-to-continuous outliers may deserve closer recording as
 * events in their own right.
 *
 * Mean computation must "decay" as it ages, we do this by halving the sum and
 * count after .us_decay_unit us.
 *
 * We don't acknowledge outliers until there are at least .min_contributors
 * in the current mean (which is subject to decaying)
 *
 * We decide something is an outlier event if it deviates from the mean by
 * .pc_outlier_deviation %.
