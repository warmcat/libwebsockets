# lws minimal http server multivhost

This creates a single server that creates three vhosts listening on both :7681 and
:7682.  Two separate vhosts share listening on :7682.

|vhost|listens on port|serves|
---|---|---
localhost1|7681|./mount-origin-localhost1
localhost2|7682|./mount-origin-localhost2
localhost3|7682|./mount-origin-localhost3

Notice the last two both listen on 7682.  If you visit http://localhost:7682,
by default you will get mapped to the first one, localhost2.

However if you edit /etc/hosts on your machine and add

```
127.0.0.1 localhost3
```

so that you can visit http://localhost3:7682 in your browser, lws will use the
`Host: localhost3` header sent by your browser to select the localhost3 vhost
for the connection, and you will be served content from ./mount-origin-localhost3

## build

```
 $ cmake . && make
```

## usage

```
 $ ./lws-minimal-http-server-multivhost
