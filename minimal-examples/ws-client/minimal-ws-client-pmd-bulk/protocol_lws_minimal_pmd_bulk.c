	"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth "
	"century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by "
	"intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as "
	"men busied themselves about their various concerns they were "
	"scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a "
	"microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and "
	"multiply in a drop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to "
	"and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their "
	"assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the "
	"infusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought to "
	"the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of "
	"them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or "
	"improbable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of "
	"those departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be "
	"other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to "
	"welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds "
	"that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, "
	"intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with "
	"envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  And "
	"early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment. "
